# ChatBot

*A lab report by Hemanth Kondapalli*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**
I made a chatbot that makes travel suggestions. I changed the questions to questions about a traveler's preferences for travel, like what climate, season and activities would they like to do. The chatbot matches the input text from the user to a travel destination by matching words and keywords. I added a few datatypes to store the user responses and I created a list of keywords for each destination. And in the matchDestination, I calculate the word frequency of the key words for each category and return the destination with the largest category. 

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!** <br>
